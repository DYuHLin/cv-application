# CV Application

This was my first React application (besides ones that I have created with video tutorials) that I did on my own. I learnt a lot about React.
I learnt how to create a react application, setup components, remove the dummy data. I also learnt how to work with classes, state and props. I learnt how to pass state as a prop and edit state. Then I learnt how to use functional components when I changed the application from classes to function. I learnt how to use UseState, react-to-print, useRef and gained a better understanding of the map function and how to use it with useState.
